## Getting Started

You can log in using the following test account:

- **Email**: testuser@example.com
- **Password**: testpass123

Note: The backend server is currently under development. If you'd like to create your own account, you'll need to run the server locally. However, as the server is not yet fully complete, we recommend using the test account for now.
